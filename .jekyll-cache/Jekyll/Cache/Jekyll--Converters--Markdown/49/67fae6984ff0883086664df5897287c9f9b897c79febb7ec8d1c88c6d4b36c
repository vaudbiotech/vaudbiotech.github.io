<h1 id="product-description">Product description</h1>
<p>Product Profile ‚Äì Our product is a monoclonal antibody to be used in a phase 1 clinical trial in oncology. The company is named VaudBioTech with headquarters located in Switzerland. This company is the discoverer of the product in question. The planned phase 1 clinical trial will be conducted in Germany.</p>

<p><strong>Group:</strong> C</p>

<!-- **Group members:** Priya Bhutada, Mouna Hadiji, Raluca Lidia Ganea, Dylan Lawless, Olivia-Augustina Colbea. -->

<p><strong>Company:</strong> VaudBioTech</p>

<p><strong>Product name</strong>: Hertumig.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment of HER2 receptor positive breast cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery</strong>: Subcutaneous administration.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism/target</strong>: Similar to the mode of action from Pertuzumab and Herceptin (as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>), Hertumig targets a newly defined antigen of HER2 which inhibits the ¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer">dimerization</a> with other HER receptors, thereby preventing ¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu#Signal_transduction">signalling</a> ¬†in ways that promote cell growth and proliferation. HER2 positive breast cancer is caused by ERBB2 gene amplification that results in overexpression of HER2 in approximately 15-30% of breast cancer tumors. Stimulates cell proliferation and cell growth. It is a bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) which targets two epitopes.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: This drug is reminiscent of the classical mAb anticancer treatments; (i) similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertuzumab">Pertuzumab</a> (RG6264, Perjeta) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech">Genentech</a>¬†which was first approved in 2012, Europe in 2013, etc. (ii) similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab">Trastuzumab</a>, Herceptin from Genentech very well known, approval US 1998, EU 2000, WHO essential medicine.</p>

<h1 id="drug-development-summary">Drug development summary</h1>
<p>The drug development plan will be completed based on our template: Case_study_group_C_template.docx.</p>

<p>The source documentation is summarized in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are well established as cancer therapies. As early as 1890, the neutralizing effect on diphtheria was known [1]. In 1980, human trials of mAb therapy for the treatment of lymphoma were as performed and with the advent of antibody humanization later that decade, this treatment strategy became a powerful tool for precision medicine [1].</p>

<p>The advent and rise of mAb is a triumph for clinical medicine. Since the beginning of their modern understanding, the applications for mAb have been recognisedrecognized; ‚Äúa 1975 Nature paper reported how cell lines could be made that produce an antibody of known specificity‚Äù [2]. While these early days of antibody production - relying on hybridoma technology - were challenging, today mAb are often produced by by isolation or transformation of Ab-producing cells taken directly from immunized animals or humans. The immunoglobulin genes responsible for the Ab of interest are subsequently transplanted into cell lines [2].</p>

<p>Recently (2021), the FDA approved the 100th mAb product [3]. The timeline starts inat 1986 with the majority of products consisting of canonical antibodies, and a small number of alternative constructs including antibody‚Äìdrug conjugates, bispecific Abs, fragment Abs, and others. While a high potential exists, the hurdles for biological drug approvals limit the number of products available thus far. ‚ÄúJust ten targets‚Ä¶ account for 42% of the approvals to date‚Äù: PD1/PDL1, CD20, TNF, HER2, CGRP/CGRPR, VEGF/VEGFR, IL-6/IL-6R, IL-23 p19, EGFR, and CD19 [3].</p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of monoclonal antibodies is generally well understood. The major drug disposition processes relevant for mAbs can be estimated in preclinical development. The product-specific and patient-specific factors that can affect PK behavior can be considered for successful clinical therapy [4].</p>

<p>Each particular mAb has unique risks. The steps to identify and minimize potential adverse effects must be clear and accurate. preclinical and clinical protocols must be established to avoid infusion reactions [5]. Preclinical validation of in vitro safety using human tissues is necessary to predict potential outcome for administration to humans. For clinical trial volunteer safety, communication must be maintained between scientists and clinicians both in phama/biotech companies and those performing clinical studies [5].</p>

<p>The serious risks of off-target antigen binding are well-known, particularly after the adverse outcome seen during the phase 1 trial of anti-CD28 mAb TGN1412 resulting in systemic inflammatory response in all six volunteers [6].</p>

<p>Despite the known potential for first-in-human studies there is no current robust way to ensure complete safety. Therefore, adherence to guidance and regulatory protocols are vital for safe and successful trials.</p>

<p>mAb are recognized as versatile platforms for cancer immunotherapy by directly stimulating or inhibiting immunological protein pathways [7]. The induction of antitumor immune responses can be exploited to develop new cancer treatment strategies based on tumor-specific response of natural or engineered mAb [7].</p>

<p>The nomenclature for our drug is defined according to the WHO International Nonproprietary Names (INN) (Programme and Classification of Medical Product) [8]. The current state of the art in anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is overviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319201/">Chiavernna, et al</a>. [9].
